The code include answers to the follwoing questions:

<b> Question 1</b> 

Use the data file “Spirit_Quality.csv” for Question 1. It contains data on a set of spirits and their characteristics.

1.	Display variables of the data set and their data types. 

2.	How many records are there in the data set?  …………………………………..

3.	What is the highest fixed acidity value present in data? ………………………..

4.	Calculate the difference between mean fixed acidity and median volatile acidity……………………….

5.	Display the count of spirits that falls into each category of the quality variable.

6.	Replace the values of “quality index” variable as follows: 
0 –> “bad”; 
1 –> “moderate”; 
2 –> “good” 
and Rename the “quality index” column as “quality categories”.

7.	(i) Group the data using “cost group” and calculate mean values for alcohol amount, residual sugar, chlorides and sulphates for each category in “cost group”.  Display mentioned variables only.

    (ii) Describe the relationships you see in categories of cost group variable and mean alcohol amount. 


8.	Get the total acidity of spirits by adding “fixed acidity” and “volatile acidity” and store the values in a new column called “total_acidity”. Save the data set as a csv file having the name as “Total acidity” 

9.	Get the records of spirits which has pH value less than 3.0 and Save the data set as a csv file having the name as “Low PH” 

10.	Get a subset of data with the columns; fixed acidity, volatile acidity, citric acid, free sulfur dioxide, total sulfur dioxide, sulphates and quality and Save the data set as a csv file having the name as “acid_and_sulpher”

11.	Draw a suitable graph to display the distribution of “volatile acidity” with suitable axis labels.


12.	
    (i) Which data problem you see in the distribution of “volatile acidity”? 
...........................................................................................................................................................
   	
    (ii)  Using a suitable method, display the entries having the identified issue. 

   	(iii)  What do you suggest to overcome the problem?
            ………………………………………………………………………………………………………………………………………………………
   	
    (iv)  Perform your suggestion and store the new …volatile acidity values in a new column called, “volatile_acidity_new”. Save the data as a csv file having the name as “cleaned_data”

14.	(i) Draw a suitable graph to display the relationship between “free sulfur dioxide” and “total   …..sulfur dioxide” with suitable axis labels.

    (ii) What conclusions can you make on this?

14.	(i) Merge “Spirit_Quality.csv” and “Spirit_QualityNew.csv” such that the data loss is the least and …..the data loss is the most with suitable names for the merged data.  

    (ii) Display the number of records in the resulting set of data in each of the above situations.

<b> Question 2 </b>

Use the data file “Flights_data.csv” for Question 2. Data set contains fight passenger data from January, 1949 to December,1960.


1.	How many observations are there which contain at least one missing value? ………………………………..
2.	List the variables which contain missing values, with the corresponding number of missing values in each variable.

3.	Calculate the percentage of missing values (out of rows) for each of the variables.

4.	Suggest a remedy for the missing values in “loss of luggage” variable with sufficient reasoning.

……………………………………………………………………………………………………………………………………………………..
 Perform your suggestion and Save the data set as a csv file having the name as “Flights_data_new1.csv”

5.	(i)	What would you suggest as a remedy for missing values in “average number of passengers” variable with reasons. 
…………………………………………………………………………………………………………………………………………………………………………………………………………………………………………………………………………………………………………..

    (ii)	Perform your suggestion (Hint: You can use any mathematical calculation). Describe the steps used.
………………………………………………………………………………………………………………………………………………………………………………………………………………………………………………………………………………………………………………………………………………………………………………………………………………………………………………………………

    (iii)	Save the data set with your performance as a csv file having the name as “Flights_data_new2.csv”

    (iv)	Do you think dropping records containing missing values is reasonable in this data? Give reasons.
